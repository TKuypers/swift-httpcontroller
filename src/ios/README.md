### iOS (XCode)
To let swift work with Cordova it is required to link **Bridging-Header.h** to your application. 
Add to following line to **Objective-C Bridging Header** in the **Build Settings** tab
```

```
Or add the following line to a already existing Bridging Header:

```
#import <Cordova/CDV.h>
```

#### Additional Build settings

```
